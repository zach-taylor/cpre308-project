Overall, address space layout randomization is a major benefit to any operating system. ASLR is an excellent security measure that thwarts potentially crippling attacks such as stack and buffer overflow attacks. By concealing the locations of a process’s key memory segments, it minimizes the probability of an attack succeeding. The probability decreases as the search space of the randomization increases, which makes 64-bit architectures perfect for this protection. In the right scenarios, ASLR has minimal performance costs.

During this study, I explored a powerful security feature that is implemented in almost all modern operating systems, even mobile ones. I had the chance to explore some common attacks on an operating system and the vectors in which they occur. Prior to my research, I was aware of what buffer overflows were, but was not familiar with how they could be used to violate a system’s intended use. This was a very interesting and useful project to engage in.
